13.	Q: What is an enumeration? 
    A: Setting a list in assenting order.
14.	Q: What is inheritance?

15.	Q: Is multiple inheritance supported? 
    A: Yes 
16.	Q: What is the purpose of as operator?
    A: An operator can perform operations like mathematic calculations that it could not do normally.
17.	Q: What is an object? 
    A: Object can hold many types of classes.
18.	Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class? 
    A: Structure are for value type while a class are for reference types.
19.	Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements? 
    A: Continue are for skip a line of code while a break are for breaking out of a block of code.
20.	Q: What is this and how is it used?
    A: This is for modifier a method
21.	Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?

23.	Q: What is finally and what is its purpose? 
    A:Finally serves to mask what is included and what is not.
24.	Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
    A: Arrays are preset before the program runs and the arraytlist  can be added to will the code is running.
25.	Q: What is an object?

26.	Q: Define constructor.
    A: Constructor are there to help set variables to objects.

28.	Q: What is an abstract class?
    A: An abstract class is an unfinished class that can only run in a derived class.
29.	Q: What is an interface?
    A: Interfaces are for classes to share similar functions
30.	Q: What is a method?
    A: Methods are codes that can run groups of code.
31.	Q: What is a property?
    A: Property is public values but hidden code.
32.	Q: What is an access specifier?
    A: Access specifier are public classes
33.	Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
    A: That it’s outside the set class.
34.	Q: What is a collection?
    A: Collection are objects that can change size.
35.	Q: What is a Hash Table?
    A: Hash Table are for key-value pairs that can find values.
